# Diabetes_Patients_Project

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for diabetes using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing various health-related features to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Repository Contents
Jupyter Notebook: The core analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb). The notebook covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation metrics for diabetes prediction.

# Dataset:
The raw dataset (diabetes_data.csv) is included in the repository, containing health metrics and diabetes outcomes for individuals.

# Key Findings
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated the dataset to understand the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identified potential correlations between health metrics and diabetes diagnosis.

Feature Selection: Utilized statistical methods and correlation analysis to select relevant features that strongly influence diabetes prediction.

Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for diabetes prediction.

Performance Evaluation: Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance and chose the best-performing model.
